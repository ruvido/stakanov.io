# TODO

## Urgent

- IMPORT module for payments (i.e. donations)
- [backup] mongolab database (cron stuff, ok to do it on pumaPRO)
- [fix] unify donations and invoice shemas --> payments


## Backend

- include invoices as an array for each event (wedding)
- Mongoose Schema for Configurations:
    + public folder (static files)
    + root routing folder
    + static assets (e.g. downloadable invoice files)

## Frontend

- ajax, monkberry, react, vue
