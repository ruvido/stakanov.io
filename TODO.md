# TODO

## Urgent

- send invoices (IMPORTANT: re-import all data "no-dude")
- send donation receipts

## Backend

- line 116 of test --> actual email recipients (name <email>)
- check async functions in sendmailer (especially -> pdf creation)
- include invoices as an array for each event
- make invoice template unique between "view" and "send email"

## Frontend

- include a minimal css framework (make a list)
- ajax call to delete an invoice
- view call (better format)
