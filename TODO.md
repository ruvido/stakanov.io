# TODO

## Urgent

- BACKUP mongolab database (cron stuff, ok to do it on pumaPRO)

- send donation receipts

## Backend

- include invoices as an array for each event
- make invoice template unique between "view" and "send email"
- Mongoose Schema for Configurations:
    + public folder (static files)
    + root routing folder
    + static assets (e.g. downloadable invoice files)

## Frontend

- include a minimal css framework (make a list)
- ajax call to delete an invoice
- view call (better format)
