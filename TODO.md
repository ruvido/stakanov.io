# TODO

## Urgent

- BACKUP mongolab database (cron stuff, ok to do it on pumaPRO)
- send donation receipts

## Backend

- build a general API (both for invoice and donations)

- include invoices as an array for each event (wedding)
- make invoice template unique between "view" and "send email"
- Mongoose Schema for Configurations:
    + public folder (static files)
    + root routing folder
    + static assets (e.g. downloadable invoice files)

## Frontend

- ajax, monkberry, react
